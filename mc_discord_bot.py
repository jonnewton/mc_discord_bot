# A simple discord bot by Jon Newton to connect a single (tested on vanilla) minecraft server instance to a single discord server
# written because I was challenged to do so by a family member :)
# developed for linux (tested on ubuntu).
#
# current capabilities:  
#   1: All minecraft chat is mirrored to a discord channel ('mcchat' by default)
#   2: All messages in the specified discord channel are mirrored to the minecraft chat by default
#   3: Minecraft commands can be run from discord by sending a message "<cmd> minecraft command"
#   4: Authentication such that minecraft commands can only be run by a user in a sepcified discord server role ('mc cmds' by default)
#   5: you can get the current public ip of the minecraft server from within discord by typing <ip>
#   6: you can get the list of players currently on the minecraft server from within discord by typing <who>
#   7: Written to be relatively easy to hack/extend (hopefully)
#
# Please ensure that your bot is not made public as it is only designed to be used for a single discord server at a time
# Currently, you will need to create the channel and auth role in your discord server manually.
#
# Dependencies:
#   python3 (version 3.8): apt install python3
#   discord: install: 'python3 -m pip install -U discord.py'
#   mcrcon: install: 'python3 -m pip install -U mcrcon'
# 
# QuickStart:
#   You need to have created a discord bot and invited it to your server (handy instructions here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
#   ensure that rcon is enabled in your minecraft server settings (we use this to communicate with the server)
#   create the channel 'mcchat' in your server
#   place this python file in the same directory as your minecraft server
#   ensure your minecraft server is runnin (currently this does not work if you start the server afterwards)
#   run as follows:  DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='mytoken' python3 mc_discord_bot.py
#   type <help> in discord and the bot should respond.
#
# (The other important settings can be changed using env vars  - see below.  )
